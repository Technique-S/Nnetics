# Payment core validation — 29 October 2026

**All requested automated Milestone 1 checks pass in Linux. Overall milestone acceptance remains incomplete pending independent review of the bounded light-client consensus and resource assumptions.** No audited or production-ready verifier claim is made.

## Actual successful execution

[GitHub Actions run 40867146834](https://github.com/Technique-S/Nnetics/actions/runs/40867146834) tested commit d515974d64656caa62666b97b4d5fce494340166 on branch codex/payscope-milestone-1. It finished successfully at 11:48:20 UTC on 29 October 2026. Environment: Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64, Node 24.22.1, Rust/Cargo 1.93.0, near-sdk 5.29.1, near-workspaces 0.23.0, near-sandbox 0.3.12 / nearcore 2.13.0 (protocol 86).

| Check | Written | Executed in this run | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript reference policy | 34 tests | 34 | Passed |
| RPC proof normalization | 7 tests | 7 | Passed |
| Rust SDK unit tests | 30: 13 original + 17 proof/finality cases | 30 | Passed; 0 failed, ignored or filtered; 1.43 seconds |
| Rust sandbox tests | 14 top-level tests with additional case matrices | 14 | Passed; 0 failed, ignored or filtered; 195.80 seconds |
| Production WASM | Default features | Built | Passed |
| Callback fault WASMs | Record/finalize × gas/storage | All four built | Passed |
| Production Clippy | WASM release library, -D warnings | Executed | Passed |
| Rust formatting | Both crates | Executed | Passed |
| Evidence retention | Stage logs, manifest, WASM, receipt proofs/results | Uploaded and downloaded | Passed |

There are no written-but-unexecuted Rust test cases in the current suite. This does not establish coverage of every possible consensus/resource condition.

The tested production WASM is 421,025 bytes, SHA-256:
e97f89494906baf07a818102aa58c343c1f8279ca6be72d4bfbc9f8af5f0b78f

This checksum matches both final Linux runs. The successful run's manifest records source/configuration/lockfile hashes, all stage exit codes and nonzero Rust test counts. A subsequent documentation-only commit does not change the verified source.

## Recipient balances and repair evidence

The normal successful payment increased the recipient from 100000000000000000000000000 to 102000000000000000000000000 yoctoNEAR: exactly **2 NEAR**. The final payment is Paid, spent is 2 NEAR, reserved is zero and last_attempt is 1. The full PAYMENT_EVIDENCE record is in logs/sandbox-tests.log.

The historical-proof matrix executed all four cases:

| Lost result callback | Native transfer | Exact recipient delta | Repaired status | Final reserved / spent | Repair gas burned |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gas exhaustion | Success | 1 NEAR | Paid | 0 / 1 NEAR | 5,072,292,929,148 |
| Gas exhaustion | Failure | 0 | Failed | 0 / 0 | 5,190,522,132,805 |
| Protocol storage failure | Success | 1 NEAR | Paid | 0 / 1 NEAR | 5,072,341,471,752 |
| Protocol storage failure | Failure | 0 | Failed | 0 / 0 | 5,186,041,151,479 |

Each case kept the reservation while the outcome was unknown, verified actual node-generated inclusion proofs under signed head updates, rejected tampering, repaired through an unprivileged account while paused/revoked, and rejected replay. Balance deltas were captured before recipient-signed calls consumed gas. Raw proof bundles and final payment/vault/audit records are retained in evidence/. These gas measurements are for the exercised sandbox proofs, not maximum-size proofs or validator sets.

All 12 core sandbox tests also passed: exact payment and duplicate guards; concurrent same-order, shared-invoice and budget competition; amount/recipient/cap/budget/funding checks; pause, vendor/order/agent revocation and expiry; account/key/deposit/private-callback restrictions; real failed transfers and safe retry; bounded retries and immutable order IDs; storage/liquidity rejection with state rollback; callback gas/storage fault matrix and durable-evidence reconciliation; unknown client outcomes resolved by views without resubmission.

The two additional sandbox tests passed the four historical-proof cases above and frozen checkpoint authority. Unit tests passed expiry boundaries, signer/predecessor and stale callback checks, in-flight revocation, immutable recipients, hashes compared with official near-primitives types, signed quorum/epoch transitions, invalid signatures/truncated approvals, stale heads, unknown/tampered/unrelated/stale/replayed evidence, consumed receipt rejection, ambiguous initiating receipts and immutable bootstrap.

## Execution failures and corrections

| Run / commit | Actual result and correction |
| --- | --- |
| [40862869517](https://github.com/Technique-S/Nnetics/actions/runs/40862869517) / 9206f07 | TypeScript 41 passed; Rust unit compilation failed on eight test hash conversions and one mock context field. Zero Rust tests executed. Fixed in 7125f38. |
| [40863230050](https://github.com/Technique-S/Nnetics/actions/runs/40863230050) / 7125f38 | Rust unit 29 passed, 1 failed. Official-type comparison detected a real validator public-key length-prefix mismatch. Corrected consensus encoding in 919be5b; preserved the comparison assertion. |
| [40863676284](https://github.com/Technique-S/Nnetics/actions/runs/40863676284) / 919be5b | Rust unit 30 passed; sandbox 0 passed, 14 failed during setup: finite worker-key allowance was below the sandbox upfront gas check. Raised only the ephemeral test key allowance to 100 NEAR in 47e059f; method restriction unchanged. |
| [40864788315](https://github.com/Technique-S/Nnetics/actions/runs/40864788315) / 47e059f | Rust unit 30 passed; sandbox 0 passed, 14 failed at the setup rejection probe with an opaque WASM trap. Missing --cfg near selected off-chain SDK fallbacks. Corrected target flags and added a compile-time guard in d2ec5a7. |
| [40865934492](https://github.com/Technique-S/Nnetics/actions/runs/40865934492) / d2ec5a7 | Rust unit 30 passed; sandbox 13 passed, 1 failed. Real proof/callback matrices passed. Storage-shortfall fixture accidentally reset the deployed code hash. Fixed in d515974 by preserving current account fields and checking unchanged code/storage. |
| [40867146834](https://github.com/Technique-S/Nnetics/actions/runs/40867146834) / d515974 | All checks passed: TypeScript 41, Rust unit 30, sandbox 14, five WASM builds, Clippy and formatting. |

**Artifacts built before d2ec5a7 must not be deployed.** Compilation and structural WASM validation did not detect the missing SDK on-chain configuration; sandbox execution did. The corrected .cargo/config.toml applies --cfg near to WASM builds, matching [official cargo-near behavior](https://github.com/near/cargo-near).

Earlier Windows native unit compilation failed before executing tests because dlltool.exe was unavailable. That environment failure is superseded by the Linux execution above. Additional local checks executed: Bash/report syntax; synthetic report failures for zero tests/missing stages (exit 80); configured WASM build with panic_utf8, sha256 and ed25519_verify host imports; a deliberately misconfigured WASM check rejected by the explicit --cfg near compile guard (exit 101, artifacts/local-checks/missing-near-cfg.log). These checks are separate from the Linux test counts.

## Reproduction and retained evidence

Run bash scripts/check-core.sh from the repository root on Linux x86_64 with Node 24 and rustup. Ubuntu prerequisites: build-essential, pkg-config, libssl-dev, clang and cmake. rust-toolchain.toml pins Rust 1.93.0, formatter, Clippy and the WASM target. Both Cargo lockfiles are committed; preserve near-sdk-env 0.1.6 and near-sys 0.2.14 compatibility pins.

The workflow .github/workflows/payment-core.yml uses Ubuntu 24.04 and pinned official action commits. It runs the script, which rejects sandbox binary overrides, builds fault variants in separate target directories and uses only fresh local nodes with synthetic accounts. No wallet, faucet, deployment credentials or public RPC is needed. Ambient Rust flag overrides cannot silently omit --cfg near: the contract compilation guard rejects them.

Every run gets a fresh artifacts/runs/ directory. Missing stages, zero-test Rust summaries or failed report generation fail verification. Actions uploads logs, checksums, the production WASM and available public sandbox proof/result bundles even on failure. The manifest deliberately leaves milestone_1_accepted false for review; a green workflow is not an automatic security approval.

All completed-run artifacts were downloaded to ignored artifacts/github/<run-id>/. The successful evidence is in artifacts/github/40867146834/payment-core-40867146834-1/20261029T114033Z-40867146834-1-2953/. The tested production WASM is also copied to ignored artifacts/vault.wasm. GitHub artifacts expire after 14 days; the local downloaded copies remain available.

## Preserved contract and repair authority

The pre-continuation source, tests, validation report and WASM are preserved under ignored .tools/m1-baseline/. Original contract source SHA-256: b0321c1c2f7b80479ed0119f9cdccacd20ba5bfe3862e4b04609aa0b0d202c40. The original WASM was 290,318 bytes, SHA-256 917e6b59fa879582421593e8d9d4c849048ae87ae11faa53a9fe6273ab172654; it predates the corrected build configuration.

Vault, WorkOrder, Payment, status variants and collection prefixes retain their serialized layouts. Proof state uses separate versioned prefixes. Source layouts were compared; sandbox fault-code replacement also exercised shared serialized state, but no generic legacy migration was implemented or claimed.

[HISTORICAL_REPAIR.md](HISTORICAL_REPAIR.md) defines authoritative evidence: a one-time pre-payment trust anchor; subsequently verified signed finality/ancestry; finalized initiating and exact native-transfer receipt proofs; exact attempt/marker/recipient/child linkage; permanent receipt consumption. Anyone may relay heads or submit valid repair proofs. Unknown, invalid, unfinalized, stale, replayed or ambiguous evidence cannot release reservations. No owner outcome flag, timeout release or balance heuristic is accepted.

## Remaining limitations and access

No additional environment access is needed. The user supplied [Technique-S/Nnetics](https://github.com/Technique-S/Nnetics), explicitly authorized pushing, and completed GitHub authentication. Branch pushes, Ubuntu execution and artifact retrieval succeeded. No public-network transaction was signed or deployment performed.

Independent review remains necessary for the trusted bootstrap, consensus encoding/protocol assumptions and worst-case gas/storage bounds. Real tests exercised the small sandbox validator set and its signed updates; maximum 128-validator/64-sibling/128-KB inputs were not benchmarked in the VM. The bounded verifier supports Ed25519/protocol-86 encodings and requires timely authenticated synchronization under normal PoS/light-client assumptions, including weak subjectivity. Unsupported evidence fails closed and can leave an attempt blocked.

Old attempts lacking an initiation marker or pre-payment checkpoint remain blocked; the owner cannot install a post-incident trust root or use a migration escape hatch. Resolving such legacy history requires a separately reviewed design. Public-network provisioning, transactions and deployment still require separate approval.

Automated payment-core acceptance checks are now satisfied, including retained exact balances and real proof repair/rejection. Overall Milestone 1 acceptance remains incomplete while the stated consensus/resource review is outstanding. UI, worker, AI extraction and testnet demonstration remain outside this milestone.
